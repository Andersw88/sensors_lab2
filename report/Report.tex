\section{Introduction: Structured light cameras}
Structured light cameras are a low-cost option for depth measuring in three dimensional space. The cameras project a known light pattern to a scene and record the reflection of that light pattern. This recorded data is then used for triangulation.\par
For this lab, the ASUS Xtion Pro sensor was used as a structured light camera.
\section{Task and implementation}
The task at hand was to set up and calibrating the sensor, as well as to characterize the noise in the depth measurement and to set up filtering routines.
\subsection{Basic setup}
To set up the camera, the package \texttt{openni2} for ros-indigo was used. %When launching the node \texttt{openni2.launch}
When starting the openni ROS drivers for the camera it publishes a wide range of topics from the camera.\par %TODO: Maybe list ALL the topics?
For this laboration, only the topics which publish a viewable image were of interest. This included two main topics:%TODO: Explain the opencv stuff

%/camera/rgb/image_raw ?
%/camera/rgb/image_rect ?

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{/camera/rgb/}\\
    This topic publishes data from the RGB camera on the ASUS Xtion Pro. The topic \texttt{/camera/rgb/raw} shows the unprocessed RGB image like a regular camera. A sample image from this topic is shown in figure \ref{fig:rgb-raw}.
  \item \texttt{/camera/depth/}\\
    This topic publishes the depth data as a 2D-array of float variables containing the depth values in meters. A sample image from this topic is shown in figure \ref{fig:original_depth}.
  \item \texttt{/camera/depth\_registered}\\
    This topic combines the RGB and the depth image into a coloured point cloud. A visualization of this topic through the tool \texttt{rviz} is shown in figure \ref{fig:depth_registered}.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Basic ROS node}
\label{sec:basic-ros}
After the basic setup, a ROS node template was used as a base to process the images and point clouds published. The received images are shown in figure \ref{fig:rgb-raw} and figure \ref{fig:original_depth}.
\subsection{Color camera calibration}
\label{sec:calibration}
In this part the color camera was calibrated using a checkers board print. Camera calibration is used to remove distortion in the image caused by imperfection in the camera such as the lens not being perfectly aligned to the center. We used the ROS package camera\_calibration to obtain the calibration values for the camera. To do the calibration we moved the board around within the cameras field of vision make it gather data points. The output is a set of parameters that tries to minimize the distortions when applied to images of real world objects such as the checkers board.
\par
The improvement of the calibrated picture isn't quantitatively measurable with the tools at hand, so the verification has to be carried out with judgment by the naked eye. It is possible to see a small difference between the images, but it seems like the calibration only added distortions. In the original image figure \ref{fig:checkers_board_uncalibrated} no errors can be seen but in figure \ref{fig:checkers_board_calibrated} we can see a distortion at the bottom of the image.

%Still, the difference is barely visible, which can be explained by the low correction values.  %TODO
%Nevertheless, there is a difference in straightness of the lines visible between the pictures.

\subsection{Noise characterization}
\label{sec:noise_characterization}
%Modify your ROS node to observe a small window of depth image pixels around the center of the image.  Compute average and standard deviation distances for measurements within the window
In this part we cropped small windows of varying sizes in the center of the depth image. The camera was then placed at distances varying from 0.6 to 1.8 meters as measured by measuring tape. The mean and variance of the distance values was then calculated from the depth values for the different cropped windows.
%Then the camera was placed in several known distances from a wall and the average and standard deviation of the depth values in the cropped images were recorded.\par

The mean error of 10 seconds of measurement in relation to the distance is shown in figure \ref{fig:mean_error}. The variances are shown in figure \ref{fig:variance}.\par
\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=0.8\textwidth,angle=270]{figures/mean_org_error.eps}
  \caption{Mean absolute error in meters of the mean depth in relation to the ground truth distance}
  \label{fig:mean_error}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=0.8\textwidth,angle=270]{figures/mean_org_variance.eps}
  \caption{Mean of the variance of the depth in relation to the ground truth distance}
  \label{fig:variance}
\end{figure}
Analysing the mean error (fig. \ref{fig:mean_error}), one can see that the error values diverge with the error size and the distance to the wall. Since both the ground truth distance value and in the distances measured by the camera contain errors, the accumulative error can grow substantially without further knowledge of the specific error source causing the discrepancy. But if we model the ground truth error as a relative error (e.g. $\pm5\%$), the absolute ground truth error would grow with increased distance. But since our error decreases with distance the error below one meter is possibly a systematic error in the depth measurement. 
More precise ground truth measurements are required to determine if this is the case.
%$a + bx$ where $a$ is an unknown offset from the front of the camera and $bx$ as 
%The high error values under one meter are expected to be caused by errors in the ground truth measurement, since the measuring tools at hand weren't optimal. The variance values also increase with the ground truth distance.\par
 The diverging error values and increasing variances can be explained by the geometric characteristics of the measurement (see fig.\ref{fig:geometric_representation}).
\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
   %\input{figures/geometric_example.eps_tex}
  \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{geometric_example.eps}
  \caption{Schematic of the distance measurement}
  \label{fig:geometric_representation}
\end{figure}\par
Figure \ref{fig:geometric_representation} shows a 2D schematic view of the measurement. The camera records the depth values of an area around a maximum value of $\theta$. The depth value at $C$ doesn't contain the actually desired distance to the wall $d$, but rather\[ h=\frac{d}{\cos\theta}.\]
As the distance to the wall $d$ increases, so does the absolute error between $h$ and $d$. Increasing the observed window size additionally increases $\theta$, which has a similar effect.

\newpage
\subsection{Noise filtering}
\label{sec:filtering}
In this part we applied several filters to the depth images in order to remove the noise from the measurement data. These filters are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gaussian blur
\item Median filter
\item Bilateral filter
\item Median over several image samples
\item Average over several image samples
\end{itemize}
The effect on the image data after the application of the filters will be discussed in the following.

% \subsubsection{NaN values}
% \label{sec:nan}
% Whenever the sensor can't evaluate the IR data, the according pixel in the depth image receives a \texttt{NaN} value as the depth value. This can be caused by an object standing too close to the sensor or by IR rays not reaching the sensor due to shadow casting, obstructing objects or scattering. Leaving these \texttt{NaN} values in the image data for processing would negatively influence the filters and thus should to be replaced.\par
% Two ways of replacing the \texttt{NaN} values were considered: 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Replacing the \texttt{NaN} values with a depth-value of 0.
% \item Replacing the \texttt{NaN} values with the last valid pixel scanned.
% \end{itemize}
% We chose the first method, since the replaced pixels are still identifiable as invalid. Thus, less information is lost.

\subsubsection{Filter effects}
\label{sec:filter_effects}
The original image is seen in figure \ref{fig:original_depth}.

\paragraph{Gaussian blur}
The gaussian blur filter (fig. \ref{fig:gaussian_blur}) blurs the contours of the observed objects. Additionally, the pixels with \texttt{NaN} values reproduce and strongly disturb the algorithm. This can be explained as anytime one of the pixels in the kernel is a \texttt{NaN} value, the resulting  output pixel also becomes \texttt{NaN}, regardless of any other pixel's value. This also explains the ``blocky'' artifacts in areas which originally contained small \texttt{NaN} speckles.
%as every kernel containing a \texttt{NaN} value gives every pixel in the whole kernel a \texttt{NaN} value. This also explains the ``blocky'' artifacts in areas which originally contained small \texttt{NaN} speckles.

  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Median filter}
The median filter (fig. \ref{fig:median_depth}) doesn't show a big difference to the original image.

  \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{depth_bilateral.png}
  \caption{Bilateral filter}
  \label{fig:bilateral_depth}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Bilateral filter}
The bilateral filter (fig. \ref{fig:bilateral_depth}) blurs the contours of the objects. Otherwise, no remarkable differences to the original image are discernible.\par
In order for this filter not to produce very artifact-prone images, the \texttt{NaN}-values had to be adjusted. Before applying the filter all \texttt{NaN} values were replaced with values either from the left or from above of the \texttt{NaN} value. After running the filter on the image the \texttt{NaN} values from the original where reapplied to the filtered image. This technique is not ideal since it can produce strange values new edges of large blocks of \texttt{NaN} values. It would have been also possible to modify the bilateral filter to return \texttt{NaN} if it encounters any \texttt{NaN} value in the kernel. %We chose to replace the \texttt{NaN}-values with entries of depth 0.

    \caption{Moving median image}
    \label{fig:moving_median_depth}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Median over several image samples}
The moving median image (fig. \ref{fig:moving_median_depth}) leaves the contours visible and removes smaller spots with \texttt{NaN} values. When the image moves too quickly, it has a ghosting effect, which extremely complicates any data interpretation.
\paragraph{Mean over several image samples}
The moving mean image (fig. \ref{fig:moving_mean_depth}) blurs the contours of the objects (although not as strongly as previous contour blurring algorithms). It also removes small speckles of \texttt{NaN} values. This filtering technique also suffers from too quick movement.

\subsubsection{Filters and distance error}
\label{sec:filters_distance_error}
In this part, the effects of the used filters is analyzed on the distance windows recorded in subsection \ref{sec:noise_characterization}. 
\par
All of the filters show only little change on the absolute error values. The variance values differ on the other hand, while roughly keeping the general form of the curves.

\paragraph{Gaussian filter} The gaussian filter (fig. \ref{fig:gauss_noise}) decreases the variance values by a factor of roughly $0.66$.
\paragraph{Median filter} The median filter (fig. \ref{fig:median_noise}) decreases the variance values by a factor of roughly $0.8$.

\paragraph{Bilateral filter} The bilateral filter (fig. \ref{fig:bilateral_noise}) decreases the variance values by a factor of roughly $0.5$

\paragraph{Mean over several image samples} The running median (fig. \ref{fig:median10_noise}) image shows only little change on the variance curve.

\paragraph{Median over several image samples} The running mean image (fig. \ref{fig:mean10_noise}) decreases the variance values by a factor of roughly $0.8$.

\subsubsection{Salt-and-pepper removal properties}
\label{sec:grain_removal}
The depth images didn't suffer from noise clearly visible to the eye. In order to test the noise cancelling properties of the filters, artificial salt-and-pepper noise was added to the image file. This was achieved by changing random pixels in the image to black or white in each received depth-image. %TODO:Should we include a Listing of how we did this?
\par

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\defaultwidth]{depth_Original_spice.png}
  \caption{Original depth image with salt and pepper}
  \label{fig:original_depth_spice}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Gaussian blur}
The gaussian blur (fig. \ref{fig:gaussian_blur_spice}) doesn't filter out the salt and pepper appropriately. It rather spreads the noisy data, negatively influencing the surrounding, proper data.

\paragraph{Median filter}
The median filter (fig. \ref{fig:median_depth_spice}) removes the salt and pepper speckles reliably.
